Trapped in the Kitchen
======================

Chapter 1
=========

Entering the kitchen, you, the sous-chef, are told by the chef to go to
the pantry. As you open the door to the pantry, your nostrils are defiled by the smell of something rotten.

"Phew, smells like something died in here!"

Without looking up from chopping onions, "Your momma's vag!!" says one of the triplets.

Everyone but you laughs.

* Do you::

  - get angry "throws tea-cloth at triplet's face"
  - get even "witty remark about triplet's mom"
  - ignore, "no really, what smells so bad in here"
